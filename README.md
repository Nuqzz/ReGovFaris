Project Description:
The project is a mobile application developed using React Native that serves as a user registration, login, and profile management system. The app allows users to create an account, log in with their credentials, and access their profile information. Users can update their profile information, including an "About Me" section, and save it as a draft or submit the changes.

Key Features:

1. User Registration: Users can create a new account by providing a username, password, and email address.

2. Login & Logout: Registered users can log in to the app using their username and password. The app should securely handle user authentication and session management.

3. User Profile: Upon successful login, users are directed to their profile screen. The profile screen displays the user's username and email, along with their profile picture. Users can update their "About Me" section on this screen.

4. About Me Section: The app allows users to write a short description about themselves. The text can be edited, and users have the option to save the changes as a draft or submit the final text.
